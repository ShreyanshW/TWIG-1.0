Many of these code segments were used for testing, so they may not work with full functionality.
I used the Servo Calibration Sketch to analyze the physical limits of my system(this one does not have acceleration control).
The most accurate Demo is the pick_place_DEMO, just fill out the array of servo data from the information of your arms physical limits and angle measurements.
